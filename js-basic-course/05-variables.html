      /*
      The word "let" is used to create a variable.
      
      Variable name restrictions:
      - We cant use special words. Example: let. However, we can use let1 and let2 as a variable name.
      
      let let1 = 3;
      let let2 = 4;

      - We cant start with a number. However, we can use number in the middle or in the end.

      let name1 = 3;
      let na2me = 4;

      - We cant use special characters except $_

      let name$ = 3;
      let name_ = 4; 

      Syntax rule for re-assigning a variable:
      - Don't use "let" when re-assigning a variable.
      - We cant create a variable with the same name. 
      - We can re-assign a varible as many times as we want.
